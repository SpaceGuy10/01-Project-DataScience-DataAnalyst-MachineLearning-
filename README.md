# 01-Project-DataScience-DataAnalyst-MachineLearning

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate Data Analysis, Data Science, Business Intelligence, and Machine Learning skills.  

Through this project, we apply various data science methodologies, including:  
- Dataset exploration  
- Cleaning and preprocessing standardization  
- Data visualization and interpretation  
- Business intelligence insights  
- Machine Learning modeling (using five different techniques)  

The goal is to evaluate which Machine Learning model performs best for our dataset, aiming for high prediction accuracy.

## Context: About the Dataset
This dataset provides operational and financial data from various coffee shops, enabling an in-depth analysis of factors affecting daily revenue. It includes 2,000 records, capturing key business metrics such as customer count, marketing expenses, employee staffing, and foot traffic.

### Variables:
- **Daily Revenue ($):** Total earnings per day.  
- **Number of Customers Per Day:** Footfall in the coffee shop.  
- **Average Order Value ($):** The average amount spent per customer.  
- **Operating Hours:** Number of hours the store is open.  
- **Number of Employees:** Staffing levels per day.  
- **Marketing Spend ($):** Daily investment in promotions.  
- **Location Foot Traffic (people/hour):** Number of passersby near the shop.
